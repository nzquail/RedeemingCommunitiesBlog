## Effective Life Change



The deep questions people have on the inside are: 
- What is my purpose in life?
- What was I created for? 
- Does my life have meaning? 

The answer is yes! And effective coaching can help with this!

>Why is coaching good for you? It helps us to find our WHY (purpose), and understand that God created and equipped us for a SPECIFIC PURPOSE, which is unique to US, and having the confidence that HE will guide and empower us to fulfil our destiny.


There are some differences between secular coaching and christian coaching. Secular coaching will focus on your inner strengths and encourage you to do what you feel is right.

However, Christian life coaching is based on Gods word, helps you to define your success as God sees it, not how the world sees it. Enables you to grow and achieve your goals without compromising your Christian values and operates from a foundation of faith in God. Being led by the leading and prompting of the Holy Spirit to direct your path.


## Keys to lasting change when using a biblical approach

### Seeing Yourself How God Sees You 

When you see yourself as God sees you will be able to break the limiting beliefs that you have of yourself that get in the way. It will also help you close the gap between where you are in life now and where you want to be.

### Changing your beliefs about yourself and circumstances

When you replace the lies you believe about yourself and your life circumstances with life-giving biblical truth, then your whole perspective changes about yourself and how you can live your life. 

### Be transformed by the renewing of your mind

By using scripture, this will help you to become transformed and renewed as we use the truth of Gods word, and by speaking the truth. When we are in agreement with God, the we are able to break free of the things that have been holding us back. Knowing Gods truth helps you:

* change what you believe, then your thoughts change
* change what you think, then your feelings change 
* see things differently then way you behave changes

When your mind has been renewed with Godâ€™s word, you will find that yourself walking in a new found confidence and having the courage to follow your God given dreams.

Coaching helps us to take a step back, examine our lives and to explore alternatives or make adjustments that may be needed, so you can:

* Discover your life purpose 
* Restore the balance needed in different areas in your life
* Get a fresh perspectives on personal challenges and opportunities
* Enhance your thinking and decision making skills
* Build your confidence
* Deepen your walk with God
* Demolish mindsets that are holding you back
* Improve your relationships
* Develop an effective plan of action or goals


Consider these question to discover whether you are ready to or need to be coached:

* What concerns you? 
* What would you like to work on? 
* What would you like to happen? 
* Where are you in your life at present? 

Most of these questions fall within the categories of  **family**, **career**, **health**, **finance**, **relationships** etc. 
Where we look at the **issues**, bring **awareness**, find or renew a **vision**, create a **strategy**, have a **plan of action** and find ways to **remove the obstacles**.


There are all sort of _tools_ available to help you to focus and achieve your goals - which I will add.
_Remember_ "coaching is having a purposeful conversation with someone".
