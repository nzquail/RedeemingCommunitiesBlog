## Cultivating a Redemptive Imagination
<br>

If we cultivate a redemptive imagination, then we can have a new imaginative possibility for what God would have for us in this very moment. Redemptive work is so important for us as Christians right now in the primary environments we are in, whether it is in the workplace, ministry, study, or in the home. These are the places that we get to create the world in which we inhabit, and where we get to interact with the values, world views and perspectives of others. It is in some of these places that we spend most of our time than anywhere else and learn, and some of our life experience – the good and the bad.

However, in an ever evolving society of radical change, a lot of societal progress is actually being defined without the gospel in mind. Together, if we can cultivate a spiritual imagination and bring this gift into a lot of the settings we are already in or leading, then we get the privilege of leading what’s not good, into something that is good, with the “good news”. 

But first, I think that we need to reintroduce the ideas and principles of the Kingdom of God, as I think we are missing the power behind of the knowledge of it  – so when we pray “your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven” we know that we operate in the power of it, through Jesus Christ. Then we can truly come alive in the promises and purposes of God’s Kingdom and influence change around us. 

We live in a world that is really crying out for change, though most people and are less interested in hearing the gospel, and are more interested in seeing it lived out and how it embodies in our communities and daily life. It is Gods desire to manifest his wisdom and nature in the earth, through us. 

It is helpful for us to understand our place in God’s kingdom, which helps us to understand our vocation (work), in the place where God has put us. I also believe we need to change our mindset and see ourselves being placed in our primary environments as being a “gift” from God to those around us. Though this can feel so opposite to our reality to how we feel within that environment, but we have all been given the tools, gifts and talents to help serve the world and to make it better and a bit brighter. Just imagine what possibilities you can create for someone or that something, or the change and impact you can make – you may already be doing so. There will be sacrifices, just like how Jesus lay down his life to restore mankind to God. This is how we do redemptive work, as the hands and feet of Jesus, with commitment to break out a new possibility for the kingdom here on earth as it is in heaven.
