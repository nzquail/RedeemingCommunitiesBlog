## **God's design for community**

The bible narrative shows that life together provides the context of God's redemptive action in our lives and in the lives of the world.

### **Creation-Community**

The triune God existed in community before time. The trinity means that God himself is in community - God is community: Father, Son and Holy Spirit, dwelling in perfect loving harmony and communion in his threehold being. 

He drew humanity from Himself "Let us make man in our image" (Genesis 1:26) to reflect his likeness. Humankind was born into God's community and creation for purpose, love, collaboration and friendship. This community where relationship with God and man existed together without blemish, flourished as this is where man experienced what it was to be fully human. That is why the longing for community is deep as it was created out of God's community which already existed before creation and the fall. 

To be in meaningful community as God is in external community, we are to reflect God's image in our relationships and in our communities, be in unity with each other, of the same mind and purpose, mutual love, solidarity of mission as revealed in the Father-Son relationship.

### **Broken Community-The Fall**

Because of sin, when we look at our communities today we see broken relationships, disunity, a place and space where humans are not flourishing. Sin's first devastating effects was on social structures and humans need to use other people to met their own needs. Adam and Eve experienced shame and hid themselves from God, and when God questioned them, they blamed each other.  Human community was shattered and all of creation ceased to flourish as it should. God's desired design of community has how been dismantled because of sin. Sin has made us self-reliant and twisted our relationships with others. Yet, now we have a Saviour who can deliver us from our broken relationships and teach us how to live in true community.

### **Redemtpion-Community**

We are made for community, to dwell in community with each other, though we find it hard to sustain meaningful relationships. We prefer our own individualistic life over coming together to share life with others.
