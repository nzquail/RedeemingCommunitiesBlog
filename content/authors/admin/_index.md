In today's society, there is a need for a biblical perspective when facing the challenges concerning human needs and the enviroment around us. An excitement needs to rise again knowing that we can make a positive redemptive difference for the pressing issues that surround us in our communities and in our own lives. This is my journey, exploring what "redeeming community" looks like â€“ you are welcome to join.
